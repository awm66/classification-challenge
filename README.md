Week 13 Challenge

# Functionality:
This application ingests historical ISP data and classifies emails as span or not spam. The goal is to accurately detect spam emails and filter those emails out of customers' inboxes.

# Approach:
The approach consisted of three steps.
1. Ingest, prepare, and scale the data, including creating training and testing sets.
2. Define two machine learning models, fit both, and test both.
3. Compare accuracy metrics.

# Summary of Findings:
The first machine learning model, a LogisticRegression model, achieved an accuracy score of 92.4%. The second machine learning model, a RandomForestClassifier, achieved an accuracy score of 95.4%. The latter model was approximately 3% better.

# Plagerism Statement:
No specific code was copied.
